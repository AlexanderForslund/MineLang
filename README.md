# Welcome to MineLang!!! The best, the worst, the most useless language EVER! Enjoy!

Place a chest on cords: 0 56 0
To use longer commands add max one chest to the right of the chest, making it a double chest. (Make sure it gets connected and becomes a double chest!) Max program length is therefore 54 squares.
Be careful not to place a chest at -1 56 0 as this location is used for input!

To start program type: “/i run”

When using input a lectern will spawn and you will be given a book and quill. Write the value of which you want to use in the book, and without signing it, place it in the empty lectern. This will input your value.

For further instructions read the specification (specification.md)
