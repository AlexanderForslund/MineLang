# How to use MineLANG

Welcome to MineLang!!! The best, the worst, the most useless language EVER! Enjoy!

We have gone ahead and compiled the newest version of MineLANG into the server, however if you wish to rebuild it yourself just run install on the maven script and it will output a .jar into the target folder. !!WARNING!! You have to use a JRE =< 61, deppending on your JAVA-version!

Start by placing a chest on cords: 0 56 0 (use F3 to open coordinate viewer)
To use longer commands add max one chest to the right of the chest, making it a double chest. (Make sure it gets connected and becomes a double chest!) Max program length is therefore 54 squares.
Be careful not to place a chest at -1 56 0 as this location is used for input!

To start program type: “/i run”

When using input a lectern will spawn and you will be given a book and quill. Write the value of which you want to use in the book, and without signing it, place it in the empty lectern. This will input your value.

For further instructions read the specification (specification.md)
